<h1>Betrayal</h1>
<div class="story">
 <p>
The souls gathered together in the chamber once again.
Serian stood alone at the edge, light steady but dimmed at the edges. 
Around him, other souls pulsed with anticipation, stepping forward into new stories. Choosing their patterns. 
But Serian... remained still.
A Guide appeared beside him, without sound or footsteps — only presence. “You came here seeking to expand your inner wisdom”. “And many journeys have already given you that.”
Serian’s light flickered — quietly recalling: love that dissolved, battles that never ended, endings that turned into beginnings. 

“Now,” the Guide continued, “it is time for one of your final passages.”
“Earth.”
“Earth?” he asked, the word falling heavy. “But… But… that’s one of the hardest.”
“Yes,” the Guide said. “Because on Earth, you forget. You feel everything. Pain will be sharp. Love will be heavy. Time will not bend. And truth will be questioned.”

             <img src="/images/Serian/Guide.png" alt="Kian walking across glass shards">

“Will I remember who I am?”
“Only in glimpses. Enough to ache. Not enough to stop.”
Around him, other souls shifted — some moving toward incarnation, others watching quietly.
But inside him, something older stirred.
“What will I face?”
“Betrayal. Silence. Power misused. Truth denied. You will love someone who forgets who they are. And they will hurt you.”
The Guide paused, then added —
“To rise in truth, Serian… you must first fall through illusion. That’s how the soul levels up.”
A silence passed between them. Not emptiness, but understanding.
“Will I pass?”
The Guide did not answer.
Serian pulsed once more — slow, deep. 
And then, he descended.
________________________________________
He was born under the mountains, trained as a knight beside Kael, his closest friend. They rose through the ranks together, unbreakable in battle, loyal to crown and to each other.
Until the night that shattered everything.
</p>

      <img src="/images/Serian/Kael.png" alt="Kian sitting by the fire with the being">
<p>
That night Kael had wandered too close to the edge of the royal stables. He had no intention to listen, but the King’s voice was too loud to miss:
“…they’ll never come back. The girls will be sorted — the strong ones kept, the weak ones discarded. The boys will be trained, stripped of their names and molded for war. And their parents? With no children to care for, they’ll work twice as hard without complaint. In time, the village will thank us.” Kael froze. His stomach turned. He wasn’t supposed to be there. But he had heard everything. In his panic, he ran away... unnoticed — or so he thought. A letter from his mother, that he received this morning slipped from his cloak and landed just beyond the door — right where the King would walk moments later..

"He ran to Serian the moment he could, breathless and pale. His hands trembled as he spoke. 'I heard them. The King… he’s not sending the children to learn. It’s a lie.'"
Serian listened, eyes watering with each word. “We have to warn them.”
Kael hesitated. "If we do… we could both be hanged."
But Serian was already moving.

Within days, the warning spread. Quietly at first — murmurs in kitchens, questions in the market. But the wind carried fear, and fear carried the truth too far.
As soon as the King heard about it he summoned his knights.
They gathered in silence beneath the sun. The King walked among them slowly, eyes tracing each face like a blade.
</p>
      <img src="/images/Serian/Gather.png" alt="Kian walking into fog">
      <p>
        
"There was a shadow where none should walk," he said. "2 days ago one of my knights stood where only I should have stood. Near the royal stables. Late in the night. Has anyone seen who it was?”
Kael felt his chest close in. He said nothing. He glanced at Serian, who stood calmly, hands behind his back.
But Kael knew the secret had spread — and he knew Serian had spoken. If no one confessed now, it can end up even worse. 
So Kael stepped forward.
"I saw Serian," he said. "That night. It was him."

Serian was seized. He didn’t fight back — not because he agreed, but because he already understood. He looked at Kael, not in anger, but in something deeper. A quiet sorrow.
Thrown into the stone-walled prison, Serian sat chained and bruised. The guards had struck him more than needed, perhaps to impress the King.
That evening, Kael came to the cell. He carried a cup of water and knelt beside his friend without speaking for a long time.
“I never wanted this,” Kael whispered, voice breaking. 
Serian didn’t answer. 
Kael held out the cup. “Drink. I… I mixed something in. You won’t feel the fire. It’ll be quick.”
Serian stared at the water, then back at Kael.
Then drank slowly.
In the village square, the people gathered. A wooden post rose from the ground, bound in rope and soaked cloth. Serian was tied, his head bowed.
Kael held the torch with a hand that shook. Serian was already gone. 
Kael lit it.
</p>
            <img src="/images/Serian/Fire.png" alt="Puzzle pieces on alien planet">
      <p>And as the flame touched the base, an arrow flew.
It struck Kael through the chest.
He collapsed without a sound.
Gasps rippled through the crowd. The King did not flinch.
He stepped forward, voice clear.
"We tested your loyalty," he said. "And you failed. A man who burns his brother to save himself cannot be trusted."
________________________________________
After the flames had died, and smoke still curled above the square, the King stood before his people. 
“Let it be known,” he said, “that the Kingdom protects its own. Our children are safe. They are being prepared — educated — for a greater future. But safety belongs only to the loyal. Betrayal will be met with justice, as you have seen.”
The crowd, stunned and silent, accepted his words. After all, he had silenced a traitor. Why would they doubt him?
So, one by one, the children were taken — never to return.
The Chamber pulsed.
Serian was back once more, weightless.
Kael stood before him, dimmed. Broken in light. He was no longer human — but the imprint of that life still pulsed faintly, like smoke after fire, unable to quiet just yet.
"I don’t know if I ever could do it again," Kael whispered.
Serian didn’t answer.
He turned outward — into the vast, soundless Nothingness.
This would stay with him forever — not just the fire, not just the pain, but the betrayal, the injustice…
Wounds that could not be undone.
He cannot erase them — so now, he needs to learn how to heal.
Yet beside him was Kael — still dimmed, still unravelling the echoes of what had just happened.
        </p>
         <img src="/images/Serian/End.png" alt="Kian walking into fog">
<p>Kael, his true soul-brother.
The one who had walked beside him through every storm.
The one who, even in his moment of weakness, carried the same wounds.
Kael, who would do it all again — even if he doesn’t yet know it.
Who would go down into any realm and suffer, if it meant helping Serian rise.

Still turned to the endless silence, Serian’s light pulsed — once, slow and steady.
  
"It was worth it."
  
And far below, the world kept turning.
