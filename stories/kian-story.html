    <h1>Kian — A Soul That Refuses to Shrink Just to Belong</h1>
    <div class="story">
    
      <p>The desert didn’t have sand. It had glass. Shards of ancient light, melted by time, cracked under Kian’s boots.</p>
      <p>He walked for what felt like days — alone — the final piece heavy in his pocket, humming so faintly he wasn’t sure if it was real or his own bones unraveling.</p>

      <img src="/images/Kian/kian-boots.png" alt="Kian's boots walking" />

      <p>Then he saw it. A fire, still and breathing, in the middle of the nowhere. And beside it, a figure cloaked in colorless fabric, sitting like they'd always been there.</p>
      <p>Kian approached. The warmth reached him before the light did. The being didn’t look up — just said:</p>
      <p>“You’ve come far to be no one.”</p>
      <p>Kian stopped, and the wind around him fell silent, as if even the air was listening. “I am someone.”</p>
      <p>The being stirred the fire with a long, branch-like finger. “Then why do you flinch every time you are?”</p>
      <p>Kian swallowed. His voice felt small. “Because… when I show myself, people leave.”</p>
      <p>Now the being looked up. Eyes like obsidian rivers — calm, bottomless, impossible to lie to.</p>
      <p>“Then they weren’t seeing you. They were seeing only what they could tolerate. There is a cost to being whole in a world built on fragments.”</p>
      <p>Kian sat down across the fire. “I have no one. No friends. No one who understands me.”</p>
      <p>A silence passed. Not empty — sacred.</p>

      <img src="/images/Kian/kian-fire.png" alt="Kian at the fire" />

      <p>“There are only a few like you,” the being said. “Scattered. Distant. But real.”</p>
      <p>“And if you stop searching…”</p>
      <p>The fire crackled.</p>
      <p>“…then you guarantee you’ll never find them.”</p>
      <p>Kian looked into the flames, eyes burning. “It’s easier to be quiet. To play nice. To disappear a little.”</p>
      <p>“Of course it is,” the being whispered. “But you're not here for easy.”</p>
      <p>“You're here as a soul that refuses to shrink just to belong.”</p>
      <p>Kian’s chest tightened. The words landed like ancient memory.</p>
      <p>He reached into his pocket and pulled out the last puzzle piece — metal, curved, warm.</p>
      <p>He turned it in his fingers, slowly, staring at it. “I found them all,” he said. “Every piece. But I still don’t know what I’m building.”</p>
      <p>He paused. The firelight flickered across his hands as he fiddled with the piece — over and over — as if waiting for it to speak.</p>
      <p>“You are not building a thing,” the being said softly. “You are remembering yourself.”</p>
      <p>Kian looked up. “I thought the puzzle would show me who I really am.”</p>
      <p>“It never shows,” the being said. “It reveals.”</p>
      <p>“And sometimes, what it reveals is terrifying.”</p>
      <p>Kian clenched the piece in his hand. “And if I finish it…”</p>
      <p>“Then,” the being said, “you will be you.”</p>

      <p>—</p>

      <p>A few weeks later. Kian walked through a neighborhood he used to know — where silence held everything in place.</p>
      <p>He wasn’t planning to stop. But his old neighbor, Mr. Grey, was outside watering dead grass, same as always.</p>
      <p>“Kian?” the man called out, surprised. “Haven’t seen you in a while. You still doing that... soul-searching puzzle stuff?”</p>
      <p>Kian stopped. Looked at him. Mr. Grey chuckled like it was a joke. His shirt was tucked too tight, his eyes too tired for someone pretending everything was fine.</p>
      <p>Kian tilted his head, studied him a moment, then asked:</p>
      <p>“Why are you wasting your life on something you don’t even want?”</p>
      <p>The hose slipped in Mr. Grey’s hand.</p>
      <p>Kian stepped closer — not with aggression, but with clarity.</p>
      <p>“You work a job you hate. You pretend to be someone you're not. You lie to your wife and call it kindness. You spend every day running from the voice inside you — and then blame the world for being loud.”</p>
      <p>Mr. Grey’s mouth opened. “That’s— that’s really harsh, you know.”</p>
      <p>Kian didn’t flinch. “I’m not here to be soft. I’m here to tell the truth. And I’m not willing to betray myself just to protect your comfort.”</p>
      <p>He walked on, leaving a silence behind him that would echo louder than any argument.</p>

      <img src="/images/Kian/kian-walk-away.png" alt="Kian walking away" />

      <p>Kian didn’t feel victorious. He didn’t feel angry. He didn’t feel wrong. He didn’t feel cruel. He didn’t feel broken.</p>
      <p>He felt at peace. Not because he said the hard thing — but because he finally understood that not saying it would’ve been a betrayal.</p>
      <p>He finally, finally got it:</p>
      <p>His purpose was not to fit in. His purpose was to deliver the truth — even when it felt like throwing grenades.</p>

      <hr style="margin: 2rem 0; border: none; border-top: 1px solid #d2b47e;" />

      <p>Somewhere between the realms, in the space where frequencies fold in on themselves, Kian’s puzzle pieces dissolved — light becoming dust.</p>
      <p>And then suddenly… they reappeared.</p>
      <p>Not here. Not now. But somewhere far from Earth — on a different planet, in a different reality, waiting once again for a soul brave enough to finish what truth began.</p>

      <p>And Kian? He kept walking. He followed the pull in his bones. He wasn’t searching anymore — he was aligning.</p>
      <p>And he had a feeling — deep, unshakable — that at least one of his soulmates was close.</p>
      <p>He didn’t rush. He knew now: They would find each other. The real ones always do.</p>
