    <h1>Kian — A Soul That Refuses to Shrink Just to Belong</h1>

    <div class="story">

      <p>The desert didn’t have sand. It had glass. Shards of ancient light, melted by time, cracked under Kian’s boots.</p>

      <p>He walked for what felt like days — alone — the final piece heavy in his pocket, humming so faintly he wasn’t sure if it was real or his own bones unraveling.</p>

      <img src="/images/Kian/kian-boots.png" alt="Kian walking across glass shards">

      <p>Then he saw it.</p>

      <p>A fire — still and breathing — in the middle of nowhere. And beside it, a figure cloaked in colorless fabric, sitting as if it had always been there.</p>

      <p>The being didn’t look up.</p>

      <p>“You’ve come far to be no one.”</p>

      <p>Kian stopped. “I am someone.”</p>

      <p>The being stirred the fire with a branch-like finger. “Then why do you flinch every time you are?”</p>

      <p>“Because,” Kian said quietly, “when I show myself, people leave.”</p>

      <p>The being lifted its head. Eyes like obsidian rivers.</p>

      <p>“Then they weren’t seeing you. Only what they could tolerate.”</p>

      <img src="/images/Kian/kian-fire.png" alt="Kian sitting by the fire with the being">

      <p>“There are only a few like you,” the being said. “And if you stop searching… you guarantee you’ll never find them.”</p>

      <p>Kian pulled the final puzzle piece from his pocket, turning it slowly in his fingers.</p>

      <p>“I found them all,” he said. “Every piece. But I still don’t know what I’m building.”</p>

      <p>“You are not building,” the being replied. “You are remembering.”</p>

      <hr>

      <p>A few weeks later, Kian passed through a neighborhood he once knew.</p>

      <p>His old neighbor laughed — until Kian spoke the truth he’d been avoiding his whole life.</p>

      <p>“I’m not here to be soft,” Kian said. “I’m here to tell the truth. And I’m not willing to betray myself to protect your comfort.”</p>

      <img src="/images/Kian/kian-walk-away.png" alt="Kian walking into fog">

      <p>For the first time, he felt peace.</p>

      <p>Somewhere between realms, the puzzle pieces dissolved — and reappeared elsewhere.</p>

      <img src="/images/Kian/alien-planet-puzzle.png" alt="Puzzle pieces on alien planet">

      <p>And Kian kept walking.</p>

      <p>He knew now:They would find each other. The real ones always do. </p>
